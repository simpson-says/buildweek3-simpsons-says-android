In collaboration with many hard-working students at Lambda School, I have built a little Android application which pulls data from a backend server.

## What Does the App Do?

This app's main purpose is to give users the ability to read quotes from The Simpsons based upon a selected theme.

## Who Is the App for?

The app is geared to people who are familiar with the TV series and for people who enjoy finding witty comments.

### Instructions
1. Download the [.APK](https://github.com/simpson-says/buildweek3-simpsons-says-android/blob/master/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk) to an Android device (or an Emulator)
2. Install it on the device
3. Load it up
4. The first time you run it, you will want to Register a new account
5. Type in a Username and a Password
6. Click the Login button
7. Now you can choose Search, Generate, or Favorites

#### Search

This is where you can type in a word or a phrase and see the first ten dialogue quotes where that word or phrase appears.
To see more information about a quote, click on the quote.  
**Tip: To add a quote to your list of favoties, long click the quote. You'll see a toast message as confirmation.**

#### Generate

This is where you can see a list of computer-generated script dialogue in the style of the character that you select.

#### Favorites

This one will only show items once you have favorites. If no Favorites appear here, you can go into Search and pick some.
Click a quote to see more information about it. Long click a quote to remove it from your list of favorites.

##### Conclusion

This was meant to be a fun app that displays various quotes from a TV show that has a vast repository of quotations to choose from.
I hope you enjoy it!
